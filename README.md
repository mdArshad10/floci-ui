# Floci UI

Floci UI is evolving into a unified local-first multi-cloud runtime explorer for
[Floci](https://github.com/floci-io/floci) and compatible local cloud runtimes.

It is designed to feel familiar to AWS Console users while staying honest about the current implementation: the UI only
renders real data returned by Floci-compatible APIs. If a service or operation is not wired yet, the screen stays empty
or shows an explicit placeholder. No fake resources, demo rows, or mock service data are shown in normal mode.

## Why Floci UI?

Floci exposes cloud-compatible APIs that are ideal for SDKs, CLI scripts, and automated tests, but day-to-day local
development also needs a visual layer:

- See which local cloud runtime the UI is connected to.
- Browse real local cloud resources without leaving the browser.
- Inspect service state without inventing resources.
- Use CloudWatch logs and metrics as the telemetry surface.
- Keep unsupported screens explicit instead of hiding gaps behind dummy data.

## Project Vision

Floci UI is moving from an AWS-focused local console toward a metadata-driven explorer that can render multiple local
cloud runtimes through one consistent interface.

The initial unified scope is intentionally small:

- AWS S3 through Floci AWS Core.
- Azure Blob Storage through Floci-AZ.
- AWS Compute through the Cloud Explorer adapter model.
- AWS Networking through the Cloud Explorer adapter model.
- GCP appears only as a coming-soon placeholder.

Future scope:

- More AWS services.
- More Azure services.
- GCP support coming soon.
- Plugin/adapters ecosystem.
- Observability and resource inspection.

## Architecture Principle

The rule of the project is:

- The UI does not know clouds.
- The proxy does not know internal implementations.
- The SPI defines the contracts.
- The adapters perform the translation.
- Floci Core executes the runtime.

```

The unified UI talks only to the Cloud Proxy API. The proxy resolves the selected cloud and service through the adapter
registry, then returns normalized resources and metadata schemas back to the web app.

## Architecture

![Floci Unified UI Multi-Cloud Architecture](docs/images/floci-unified-ui-architecture.png)

Short implementation notes are available in [docs/implementation-notes.md](docs/implementation-notes.md).

## Unified Storage Scope

The first metadata-driven service is `storage`.

| Cloud | Runtime | Adapter | Resource mapping | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AWS | Floci AWS Core | AWS Storage Adapter | S3 bucket -> storage resource | Implemented |
| Azure | Floci-AZ | Azure Storage Adapter | Blob container -> storage resource | Implemented |
| GCP | Future Floci-GP | GCP Adapter | Cloud Storage bucket -> storage resource | Coming soon |

Normalized resource shape:

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "cloud": "aws | azure",
  "service": "storage",
  "type": "bucket | container",
  "region": "string | null",
  "createdAt": "string | null",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## Unified Compute Scope

`compute` is available in the Cloud Explorer for AWS only.

| Cloud | Runtime | Adapter | Resource mapping | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AWS | Floci AWS Core | AWS Compute Adapter | EC2 instance / AMI -> compute resource | Partial |
| Azure | Future Floci-AZ compute adapter | Azure Compute Adapter | VM -> compute resource | Coming soon |
| GCP | Future Floci-GP compute adapter | GCP Compute Adapter | VM instance -> compute resource | Coming soon |

Current AWS Compute support in the unified Cloud Explorer:

- List EC2 instances as normalized compute resources.
- List AMIs as normalized compute resources.
- Inspect normalized instance and AMI metadata.
- Launch instances through an AWS-specific Compute panel.
- Start, stop, reboot, and terminate instances.
- View console output.
- Create AMIs from instances.
- Edit instance tags.
- Deregister AMIs.

Current limitations:

- Instance launch uses the Compute panel instead of the generic Cloud Explorer form because it needs dependent selectors
  such as VPC -> Subnet -> Security Group.
- There is no standalone legacy `/ec2` frontend page in the current UI.

## Unified Networking Scope

`networking` is available in the Cloud Explorer for AWS only.

| Cloud | Runtime | Adapter | Resource mapping | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AWS | Floci AWS Core | AWS Networking Adapter | VPC -> networking resource | Partial |
| Azure | Future Floci-AZ networking adapter | Azure Networking Adapter | VNet -> networking resource | Coming soon |
| GCP | Future Floci-GP networking adapter | GCP Networking Adapter | VPC network -> networking resource | Coming soon |

Current AWS Networking support in the unified Cloud Explorer:

- List VPCs as normalized networking resources.
- Inspect selected VPC metadata.
- Use the Networking panel for VPC, subnet, security group, gateway, route table, NAT gateway, and Elastic IP workflows.
- Create VPCs directly or through the VPC wizard.
- Allocate, associate, disassociate, and release Elastic IPs.

Current limitations:

- AWS Networking uses an AWS-specific panel because the workflows need resource-specific forms and nested operations.
- Azure VNet and GCP VPC adapters are not implemented yet.

## Current Cloud Service Status

These percentages describe UI coverage in the current frontend, grouped by the `Cloud Services` navigation model. They
do not describe backend completeness. A category can have a mature AWS-specific page while still being only partially
integrated into the unified Cloud Explorer model.

| Category | AWS | Azure | GCP | Current UI status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Storage | 95% | 80% | Coming soon | Unified Cloud Explorer support for AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Buckets/containers, object browsing, upload, download, delete, folder prefixes, metadata, and inspector are wired. AWS still has a richer legacy S3 page for bucket tags, object tags, versioning, copy, and bulk delete. |
| Compute | 70% | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS Compute is available under `/cloud-explorer/aws/compute`. It lists EC2 instances and AMIs, exposes launch/lifecycle actions through the Compute panel, supports console output, tags, AMI creation, and terminate/start/stop/reboot flows. Azure and GCP compute adapters are placeholders. |
| Networking | 75% | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS Networking is available under `/cloud-explorer/aws/networking`. The panel exposes VPCs, subnets, security groups, internet gateways, NAT gateways, route tables, elastic IPs, and a VPC wizard through EC2-backed APIs. Azure VNet and GCP VPC support are placeholders. |
| k8s Engine | 35% | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS EKS can be listed and inspected through the Cloud Explorer adapter and the dedicated EKS page. Cluster creation and node group management are not yet surfaced. |
| Database | 45% | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS database support focuses on RDS and DynamoDB. RDS is list/inspect oriented, while DynamoDB has a mature AWS-specific table/item UI. A normalized multi-cloud database model is still in progress. |
| Queue | 100% AWS legacy | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS SQS has a mature AWS-specific page for queue lifecycle, messages, tags, settings, DLQ configuration, and redrive. It is not yet exposed as a unified Cloud Explorer `queue` service. |
| Function | 90% AWS legacy | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS Lambda has a mature AWS-specific page for list, inspect, invoke, log tail, environment variables, and delete. It is not yet exposed as a unified Cloud Explorer `function/serverless` service in the frontend sidebar. |
| Events | 90% AWS legacy | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS SNS has a mature AWS-specific page for topics, subscriptions, and publish. A normalized eventing category is not wired yet. |
| Observability | 90% AWS legacy | Coming soon | Coming soon | AWS CloudWatch has a mature AWS-specific page for logs, metrics list, alarms list, and Floci request ingestion. A normalized multi-cloud observability category is not wired yet. |
| Security / Identity | Placeholder | Placeholder | Placeholder | IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager, Cognito, and related services remain placeholders in the UI. |

</details>

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- pnpm 9 or newer.
- Bun, required by `packages/api`.
- Docker, if you want to run Floci with the published container image.

### 1. Start Floci core

Floci UI needs a running Floci core server before the API and frontend can load resources.

Terminal 1, using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name floci \
  -p 4566:4566 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e FLOCI_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -u root \
  floci/floci:latest
```

Terminal 1, or using a local clone of `floci-io/floci`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floci-io/floci.git ../floci
cd ../floci
./mvnw clean quarkus:dev
```

In both cases, verify Floci core is reachable:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4566/_floci/health
```

For Azure Blob Storage exploration, also run Floci-AZ and expose it at `FLOCI_AZURE_ENDPOINT`
(`http://localhost:4577` by default). Floci-AZ routes Blob Storage requests under an Azure account path;
the local default is `FLOCI_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME=devstoreaccount1`.

For local development, the UI needs all three of these components running:

1. Floci core on `http://localhost:4566`.
2. The Floci UI API backend on `http://localhost:3001` via `pnpm dev:api`.
3. The frontend dev server on `http://localhost:3000` via `pnpm dev`.

The frontend expects `/api/*` endpoints from `packages/api`, so running only `pnpm dev` is not enough.

### 2. Install Floci UI dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure local environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Default `.env` values:

```bash
FLOCI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
FLOCI_AZURE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4577
FLOCI_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME=devstoreaccount1
VITE_MOCK_MODE=false
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
PORT=3001
```

`.env.example` already includes `VITE_MOCK_MODE=false` for real Floci usage.

### 4. Start the local API

Terminal 2:

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

This starts `packages/api` on `http://localhost:3001` and points AWS SDK clients at `FLOCI_ENDPOINT`.

### 5. Start the frontend

Terminal 3:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open the UI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

## Environment

```bash
FLOCI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
FLOCI_AZURE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4577
FLOCI_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME=devstoreaccount1
VITE_MOCK_MODE=false
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
PORT=3001
```

Floci credentials can be any non-empty value for local development. They are required because the AWS SDK expects
credentials, but Floci does not require real AWS credentials.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm build
```

## Design Direction

The target experience is a practical AWS-console-style interface:

- Dense, service-oriented navigation.
- Clear connection state in the top bar.
- Real resource counts.
- Dedicated pages for high-usage services.
- Empty states when no resources exist.
- Placeholders when a service is not wired yet.
- No decorative data or fake operational metrics.

## Contributing

When adding service UI, follow these rules:

- Use existing Floci AWS-compatible endpoints.
- Do not add custom backend endpoints just for the UI unless the core project explicitly accepts that contract.
- Prefer real empty states over sample data.
- Keep service status percentages updated in this README.
- Add verification notes for any newly wired operations.
